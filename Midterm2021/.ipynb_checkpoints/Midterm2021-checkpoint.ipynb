    "It is possible for the sidereal day on some planet to be longer than the solar day if the planet spins backwards, i.e. from east to west. Let's assume the sun and a fixed star are both overhead on the planet. After one solar day, one will see the sun overhead again. However, since the planet is also revolving forwards around the sun, the planet moved less than a full circle after one solar day. In other words, the planet spins less than 360 degrees in the solar day. The same star will therefore not yet be directly overhead after one solar day, as it will only be directly overhead after $n \\times 360$ degree ($n \\in \\mathbb{N}$), i.e. n sidereal day. Therefore, the sidereal day is longer than the solar day on this planet.\n",

In such case, we can still get a nice well-defined peak in the probability density distribution for the inferred $\\frac{m}{T}$. Then, based on this distribution and physical constraints for m (for example, m > 0), there will be constraints on T. Therefore, it is not true that any value of T is possible."
